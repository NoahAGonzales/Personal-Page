- "Student developer creator" looks like hyperlinks because it changes size
Remove the text altogether and have this information in my about?

- Spacing is weird, specifically the white space that you have to scroll past at the beginning of each page
- Not enough color
- Maybe make the theme planetary - black and blue
- looks barebones
- lines connecting the circles - like a diagram - maybe give them physics
- bubbles show over the menu background
- Use babel
